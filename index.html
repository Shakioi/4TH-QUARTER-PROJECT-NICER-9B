                <h3>Grade 9-B</h3>
                <p>Hello! You can call me  Aeisha or Kim. I am a passionate blogger who loves exploring new ideas and sharing knowledge on various topics. I am also a tranfery student here at GLC and as soon as i step on the gates of Golden Link College, I've had many new experiences that have been exciting and eye-opening. I've made great friends and met many wonderful people, which has made my time here enjoyable. This journey has pushed me to step outside my comfort zone and face challenges that I once found difficult. 

                    Whether it’s working on group projects, joining clubs, or simply talking to classmates, I’ve learned so much from each experience. I now see challenges as chances to grow instead of things to avoid. Overall, my time at Golden Link College has changed me for the better, and I'm grateful for everything I have learned.  Welcome to my corner of the internet!</p>

            <p>Having a computer subject was quite shocking for me because my previous school didn't offer this kind of course. At first, I was a bit nervous since I had never used a computer or laptop before. However, I really enjoyed our topics and learned quickly how to code; I feel like a hacker now! Here are all the web pages that I have created.</p>

            <p>I thoroughly enjoyed cooking various cuisines, whether it's an appetizer, dessert, or main dish. Through my cooking journey, I can proudly say that I have improved my culinary skills, and I am happy about it because we not only enjoy the food but also learn about its definitions, contributions, and differences. Here is an example of our performance assessment. We have performance assessments every quarter, but we only have these pictures since we are not allowed to use phones during class hours. </p>

            <h3>Output 6: English </h3>
            <p>Reading stories helps me escape from reality and enter a world of fantasy and complexity. "The Great Gatsby" is a book full of lessons, and I really enjoyed reading it. Here are some of the summary of it's chapters.</p>

             <h3>Summary of CHAPTER 1-4</h3>
           <p>Nick Carraway is the narrator of the story. The story begins by him telling what he learned from his father—not to criticize or judge a person without knowing their situation. He also mentioned Gatsby, the man who gives his name to the book and represents everything for which he has an unaffected scorn. Nick graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after his father, and participated in the migration called the Great War._____ In the spring of 1922, he decided to go to New York to bond for a business and rented an eighty-dollar house on Long Island called West Egg, a home for those having their wealth recently. East Egg was more upper class than West Egg. Nick has many connections on East Egg since he graduated from Yale. That night he went to East Egg to have dinner with his cousin Daisy and her husband Tom. After Nicks arrived at their house, he saw a young, beautiful girl named Baker, a friend of his cousin Daisy. Then they all have a conversation. After the dinner, the party ends, and Baker wants to go to bed because she still has a golf tournament tomorrow. After Nick arrived home, he saw a strange figure from far away with green light, and staring into the waters . He suggested that it was Mr. Gatsby; it was his first time seeing him. Nick lost his sight at him for a second, but the moment he looked again, Mr. Gatsby vanished. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ In Chapter Two of "The Great Gatsby," Nick Carraway goes to New York City with Tom Buchanan and Tom's mistress, Myrtle Wilson, where they have a party in an apartment that Tom keeps for his affair. At the apartment, they have a wild party with Myrtle's friends, getting very drunk and disorderly. The mood gets more chaotic as the night progresses. Myrtle provokes Tom by mentioning his wife, Daisy, which angers him. Tom becomes violent and loses his temper which leads him to hit Myrtle in her nose. This scene exposes Tom’s moral decay and selfish nature, contrasting sharply with the more refined lives of other characters in the story. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  In Chapter 3 of "The Great Gatsby," Gatsby invited Nivk to go to his party. He describes the party, it was filled with music, dancing, and a lot of people. Nick feels uncomfortable and out of place at first because he doesn't know the guests of the party. While at the party, he meets Gatsby, who is surprisingly friendly. Nick learns more about Gatsby's mysterious past. He also discovered Gatsby love for Daisy, Nick cousin. This chapter highlights the excitement and glamour of the 1920s era, but also hints at the emptiness behind the parties and the people attending them.

              <h3>Reflection of CHAPTER 1-4</h3>
           <p>In the beginning of the story, Nick Carraway mentioned that in his younger and most vulnerable years, his father gives him advice that he has been turning over his mind ever since. His father said, "Whenever you feel like criticising anyone, just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had." This wonderful beginning really caught my interest. At first, I didn't understand what it really meant because the words were too deep, but after reading it many times, I understand that this means to not criticise or make quick judgements about other people. Now this made me curious, and I questioned myself, "Do I make quick judgements on anyone?" or "Have I ever been judged by anyone? For me, it's quite difficult to be judged with and to be judgemental. How can I ever judge anyone when I'm not perfect to judge a person? And how can anyone judge me when they're not perfect enough to judge me? Well, its how the world works; people are judging one another because of some useless reasons. Yes, I've been judged by other people many times—my friends, my family, and of course strangers. I don't have proof that they're judging me, but I can see it in their eyes, and for some reason, sometimes I can hear them judging me with my own ear. Hearing someone judge my appearance, personality, and opinions hurts so much. When you try doing your best on something but it turns out it's not enough for other people to appreciate it. Sometimes someone's words can cut so deep that they leave you speechless. You're left staring at them, wondering, How can they say something so hurtful and so cruel that your brain is racing with anger, hurt, and betrayal? But what can we do? It's how the real world works. In conclusion, on this chapter, I learnt not to make quick judgements on anyone without knowing their situation because if we judge someone, you're judging yourself too. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ In Chapter 2 of The Great Gatsby, the valley of ashes is shown as a dirty and sad place. Looking at the valley of ashes made us understand how similar it looks today. This also made us realise the gap between the poor and rich people. The Valley of Ashes is a grey and grim area. The people living there, like George Wilson, are poor and have struggled to live, which is different from the wealth and luxury that can be found in other settings of the story, like West Egg and New York City. Now a days, rich people don't care about the struggles of the poor people, which leads us to compare both sides; it also reflects the dirty and sad place of society today. Dirty because people are throwing their garbage everywhere and don't care about the pollution and the decisions that we can get from it. Sad because of the problems with bills and the struggle of the poor people to find a job to get money. This is the struggle of the poor people that the wealthy people can relate to. In conclusion, the Valley of Ashes in the Great Gatsby shows the gap between the poor and rich people. This gap is still a problem today. We can see the struggle of the poor and the luxury of the rich people. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ In Chapter 3 of the Great gatsby, we explores the theme of values through the extravagant parties thrown by Jay Gatsby and the behavior of the people who attend. This chapter reveals a lot about the society of the 1920s and what people truly value. Gatsby's parties are all about luxury—there's plenty of food, endless drinks, and lively entertainment. These gatherings capture the spirit of the Jazz Age, a time when people celebrated wealth and enjoyment above all else. However, the guests who come to these parties often don't even know Gatsby; they show up just for the fun and the status of being there. These behaviour shows that people only want excitement and glamour, even though they don't know Gatsby they still go his party. In conclusion, Chapter 3 of "The Great Gatsby" reflects on the values of the time by showcasing Gatsby's grand parties and the behavior of his guests. Through the observation of Nick Carraway, he discovered a lot of secrets and unclear rumours. This shows that people on this time have no shame to each other. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ In Chapter 4 of "The Great Gatsby," we see a big difference between what characters say and how they really act. Gatsby tries to impress people by claiming he’s rich and comes from a wealthy family, but when Nick meets Meyer Wolfsheim, a shady guy linked to crime, it makes us question where Gatsby's money really comes from. Tom and Daisy Buchanan also show this gap. They talk about their values and social status, but their actions say otherwise.They claim to care about family, but their actions show they don’t. This theme is relatable in real life. Companies might say they’re ethical but act dishonestly. Politicians make promises they don’t keep, and friends might claim to be loyal but betray that trust.</p>
